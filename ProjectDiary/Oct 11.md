#### Evaluating Machine Learning Algorithms for Fake News Detection

This paper explores the application of natural language processing techniques for the detection of 'fake news', that is, misleading news stories that come from non-reputable sources. Using a dataset obtained from Signal Media and a list of sources from OpenSources.co, we apply term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) of bi-grams and probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) detection to a corpus of about 11,000 articles. We test our dataset on multiple classification algorithms - Support Vector Machines, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, Bounded Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Stochastic Gradient Descent models trained on the TF-IDF feature set performed best.
