#### Automatically Identifying Fake News in Popular Twitter Threads

Information quality in social media is an increasingly
important issue, but web-scale data hinders experts’ ability
to assess and correct much of the inaccurate content, or “fake
news,” present in these platforms. This paper develops a method
for automating fake news detection on Twitter by learning to
predict accuracy assessments in two credibility-focused Twitter
datasets: CREDBANK, a crowdsourced dataset of accuracy
assessments for events in Twitter, and PHEME, a dataset of
potential rumors in Twitter and journalistic assessments of their
accuracies.We apply this method to Twitter content sourced from
BuzzFeed’s fake news dataset and show models trained against
crowdsourced workers outperform models based on journalists’
assessment and models trained on a pooled dataset of both
crowdsourced workers and journalists. All three datasets, aligned
into a uniform format, are also publicly available. A feature
analysis then identifies features that are most predictive for
crowdsourced and journalistic accuracy assessments, results of
which are consistent with prior work. We close with a discussion
contrasting accuracy and credibility and why models of nonexperts
outperform models of journalists for fake news detection
in Twitter.
#### Automatic Online Fake News Detection Combining Content and Social Signals

In the context of social networks, machine learning
(ML) methods can be used for this purpose. Fake news detection
strategies are traditionally either based on content analysis (i.e.
analyzing the content of the news) or - more recently - on social
context models, such as mapping the news’ diffusion pattern. This paper proposes a novel ML fake news detection
method which, by combining news content and social context features,
outperforms existing methods in the literature, increasing
their already high accuracy by up to 4.8%.
